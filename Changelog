Add PV to enable/disable communication with MCH. Disable closes session.
  Change device support so that it checks enable/disable before sending message.
  Changes to drvMch.h, ipmiMsg.h, devMch.c, shelf_default.db
Increase reply timeout during init, change to drvMch.c

src/ipmiMsg.c/.h - When possible, specify expected msg response length so that 
  we don't have to wait for timeout. Return actual response length to be saved 
  for later write/reads. Keep track of incoming msg sequence numbers. 
  ipmiMsgWriteReadHelper: check msg sequence number and completion code, 
  return status. ipmiMsgReadSensor: add expected msg response length argument. 
  New routine ipmiSetDebug to set debug message flag. Register for ioc shell.
src/drvMch.c - mchPing was not locking mutex properly, fixed. Call asyn connect
  in mchInit. Intialize msg arrays to 0. Remove unneeded malloc/free. Save
  sensor read msg lengths into data structure for use later. 
  mchInit: Always call sensorFruRecordScript, even if device offline in order
  to load the default shelf records.
src/drvMch.h - Add timeout to mchData structure, for asyn reads
src/drvMchUtil.c/.h - sensorFruRecordScript: add argument to indicate device 
  online/configured. If it is not, load only shelf records.
src/devMch.c - In sensor reads, pass expected response length as argument. Check
  return status before setting record val/status. Remove unneeded malloc/free.
  read_mbbi: set reading in rval (not val) and return 0 instead of NO_CONVERT.
  Add debug print statements.
src/ipmiDef.h - Add reply message lengths. Add from-MCH sequence number offset and 
  lengths.
src/ipmiComm.dbd - register drvIpmiRegisterCommands
Db/sensor*.db - Change sensor record scan rate from 5 second to 10 second
Db/module_cu_default.sub - Add sixth fan speed sensor to defaults
